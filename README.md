## Introduction

Spectrify is a powerful tool for analyzing spectral data from various techniques, including Raman, Spectrophotometry, and FTIR. It offers a wide range of preprocessing options, spectral identification, and AI operations to simplify and enhance the spectral analysis process.

## Getting Started

To get started with Spectrify, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/SFTechnologies/spectrify-docs.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser and visit: `http://localhost:3000`

## Workspace Management

Spectrify provides a flexible workspace management system. Each workspace operates independently, allowing you to explore various types and instances of spectroscopic data simultaneously. You can create, save, and switch between different workspaces easily.

For more information, see the [Workspace Management](pages/workspace_management.mdx) documentation.

## File Management

Spectrify supports importing and exporting spectral data and associated metadata. It allows you to import data from various file formats, including the native .spsp format and plain text files. You can also export your processed data for further analysis or sharing.

For more information, see the [File Management](pages/file_management.mdx) documentation.

## Preprocessing

Spectrify offers a range of preprocessing techniques to refine raw spectral data and enhance its quality for analysis. These techniques include smoothing, normalization, baseline correction, and more. You can apply these preprocessing steps to minimize noise, remove background signals, and improve the overall signal-to-noise ratio.

For more information, see the [Preprocessing](pages/preprocessing.mdx) documentation.
