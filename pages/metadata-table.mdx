# Metadata Table

When working with spectroscopic data, it's essential to have a way to organize and describe the various spectra you're analyzing. This is where the concept of a "Metadata Table" comes into play. Think of it as a spreadsheet or a table where you can store and manage important information about each spectrum you have. You can easily access it using the "Metadata Expand button" in the lateral side of the Spectra table. For returning to standard layout, use the "Metadata Collapse button" in the lateral side of Spectra Table.

Metadata is simply data about data. In the context of spectroscopy, metadata refers to additional information that describes and characterizes each spectrum. This can include details such as the date the spectrum was recorded, the type of sample or material being analyzed, the experimental conditions, or any other relevant information that can aid in the interpretation and analysis of the spectral data.

Metadata Table is a centralized location where you can store and manage all the metadata associated with your spectra. It's essentially a table or a spreadsheet with rows representing individual spectra and columns representing different metadata attributes.

The Metadata Table plays a crucial role in facilitating further analysis and classification of your spectral data, especially when leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques. By having a well-organized and comprehensive Metadata Table, you can provide valuable context and additional features to your AI models. This can significantly improve their ability to identify patterns, make accurate predictions, and classify spectra based on the combination of spectral data and associated metadata. For instance, if you're training a model to classify different types of materials based on their spectra, the metadata columns like "Type" can serve as ground truth labels, while other columns like "Date" or "Evaluation" can provide additional features that may aid in the classification process.
