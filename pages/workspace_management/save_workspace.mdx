Allows users to save the current state of their workspace for future use in **.spws** extension.

This includes saving the layout of all open and arranged windows, documents, and any other relevant settings into a workspace file. When the workspace is reopened, it will restore the saved layout and settings exactly as they were when the workspace was saved.
