Workspaces are a fundamental feature in Spectrify, enabling users to explore various types and instances of spectroscopic data simultaneously.

Each workspace operates independently, storing its own spectra, metadata, operation parameters, and analysis results.

The spectral technique beign used is displayed in the workspace tab, next to workspace title. **Unsaved changes** will be warned by a "yellow warning dot" in this area.

Workspace management options are situated in top of the page, in the title bar. Navigation through the different open workspaces is possible by clicking on corresponding tab.
