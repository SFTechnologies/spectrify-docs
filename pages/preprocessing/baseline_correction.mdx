Baseline correction is a preprocessing technique used in spectral analysis to remove the effects of background signals that do not carry useful information about the substances being analyzed. These background signals, also known as the baseline, can be due to instrumental responses, environmental noise, or other non-target substances in the sample. By correcting the baseline, we can improve the clarity and reliability of the spectral features associated with the target substances, making it easier to identify and quantify them.

### AirPLS

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1039/B922045C 

This method is an advanced form of the least squares fitting, which aims to minimize the sum of the squared differences between the observed and fitted values. In this method, a penalty term is added to the least squares objective function to discourage overfitting. The weights in the penalty term are adjusted iteratively based on the residuals of the previous fitting, making the method adaptive to the local characteristics of the baseline. This method can effectively correct baselines that are not well approximated by simple functions, and it can also handle spectra with high noise levels.

### Iterative Polynomial Fitting

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemolab.2005.08.009

This method involves fitting a polynomial function to the baseline of the spectrum iteratively. The fitting process starts with a high degree polynomial and then gradually reduces the degree in each iteration. The threshold for determining the baseline points is adjusted automatically based on the residuals of the fitting in the previous iteration. This method can effectively handle spectra with complex and variable baselines, and it does not require manual selection of the threshold or other parameters
