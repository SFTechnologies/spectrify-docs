Baseline correction is a preprocessing technique used in spectral analysis to remove the effects of background signals that do not carry useful information about the substances being analyzed. These background signals, also known as the baseline, can be due to instrumental responses, environmental noise, or other non-target substances in the sample. By correcting the baseline, we can improve the clarity and reliability of the spectral features associated with the target substances, making it easier to identify and quantify them.

### AirPLS (Adaptive Iteratively Reweighted Penalized Least Squares )

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1039/B922045C 

This method is an advanced form of the least squares fitting, which aims to minimize the sum of the squared differences between the observed and fitted values. In this method, a penalty term is added to the least squares objective function to discourage overfitting. The weights in the penalty term are adjusted iteratively based on the residuals of the previous fitting, making the method adaptive to the local characteristics of the baseline. This method can effectively correct baselines that are not well approximated by simple functions, and it can also handle spectra with high noise levels.

> Imagine you're trying to draw a straight line through a bunch of scattered dots on a piece of paper. You want the line to be as close as possible to all the dots.This is what we call "least squares fitting" - it's like trying to find the best path through a field of dots. Now, let's say some of these dots are really far from the others, and you don't want your line to be too influenced by these far-off dots. So, you decide to give these dots less importance or "weight" when drawing your line. This is what we call adding a "penalty term" - it's like deciding that some dots are less important in deciding the path of your line. But what if the dots are not scattered randomly, but have some pattern? For example, the dots are closer together in some areas and farther apart in others. In this case, you might want to adjust the importance or "weight" of the dots based on their location. This is what we call "iteratively reweighting" - it's like changing your mind about the importance of the dots as you learn more about their pattern. This is essentially what the AirPLS method does. It's a smart way of drawing a line through a field of dots (or in our case, spectral data) that adapts to the local characteristics of the data. It can handle data that is not well approximated by a simple straight line, and it can also handle data with a lot of noise (like a field of dots with lots of far-off dots).

### Iterative Polynomial Fitting

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemolab.2005.08.009

This method involves fitting a polynomial function to the baseline of the spectrum iteratively. The fitting process starts with a high degree polynomial and then gradually reduces the degree in each iteration. The threshold for determining the baseline points is adjusted automatically based on the residuals of the fitting in the previous iteration. This method can effectively handle spectra with complex and variable baselines, and it does not require manual selection of the threshold or other parameters.

>Imagine you're trying to draw a curve through a bunch of dots on a piece of paper. You start with a squiggly line that goes all over the place, trying to get as close as possible to all the dots. This is like starting with a high degree polynomial. But then you realize that your line is too squiggly and complicated. So, you decide to simplify it a bit, making it less squiggly in each step. This is like reducing the degree of the polynomial in each iteration. Sometimes, some dots are harder to fit than others. So, you adjust your line based on the dots that are hardest to fit. This is like adjusting the threshold for determining the baseline points based on the residuals of the fitting in the previous iteration. This is essentially what the Iterative Polynomial Fitting method does. It's a smart way of drawing a curve through a field of dots (or in our case, spectral data) that adapts to the complexity and variability of the data.
