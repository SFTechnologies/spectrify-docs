Normalization is a crucial step to compare spectra obtained from different samples or under different conditions. It mitigates the common effect of a varying intensity between measurements.

### Minimun-Maximun normalization

Minimum-Maximum normalization is a technique used to adjust the scale of a signal or dataset. It transforms the data to fit within an user defined range. Typical values are between 0 and 1. This is achieved by subtracting the minimum value of the dataset from each data point, then dividing by the range of the dataset.

> Comparing the size of apples in a basket using an standard scale requires to identify the smallest one (0) and the biggest one (1). Then, you can order the rest.

### Peak normalization

Peak normalization adjust the dataset to an user defined maximun. This technique is particularly useful in spectral analysis, as it enables comparisons across the same spectral range in multiple spectra.

> To understand the relative content of caffeine in various samples, we can normalize the spectral data to 1450 nm, spectral band where this compound is visible.
