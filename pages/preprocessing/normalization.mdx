## Normalization

Normalization is a crucial step to compare spectra obtained from different samples or under different conditions. It mitigates the common effect of a varying intensity between measurements.

### Minimun-Maximun normalization

Minimum-Maximum normalization is a technique used to adjust the scale of a signal or dataset. It transforms the data to fit within an user defined range. Typical values are between 0 and 1. This is achieved by subtracting the minimum value of the dataset from each data point, then dividing by the range of the dataset.

> Consider a meteorologist comparing temperatures from different seasons. The lowest recorded temperature (e.g., in winter) is assigned a value of 0, and the highest (e.g., in summer) is assigned a value of 1. All other temperatures are scaled proportionally between these two extremes, similar to Min-Max Scaling in data analysis. This allows for a standardized comparison of temperatures across different seasons.

### Peak normalization

Peak normalization adjust the dataset to an user defined maximun. This technique is particularly useful in spectral analysis, as it enables comparisons across the same spectral range in multiple spectra.

> A chemist is analyzing the caffeine content in various beverage samples using near-infrared spectroscopy. To compare the relative caffeine content across samples, the chemist normalizes the spectral data at 1450 nm, a spectral band where caffeine exhibits a characteristic feature. By scaling the absorbance values at this wavelength, the chemist can effectively compare the relative caffeine content in each sample, allowing for a standardized assessment of their caffeine concentrations.
