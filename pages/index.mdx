# Spectrify

Spectrify offers the ultimate solution for all your spectral data needs. 

We are developing a comprehensive spectral suite for various techniques such as Raman, Spectrophotometry, and FTIR, equipped with all the necessary tools and workflows for **easy, robust, and fast analysis**. 

Our goal is to create user-centered software, making the power of spectral analysis **accessible** to everyone, while also catering to highly experienced users who can customize hyperparameters to create specific workflows and share data. Our software will soon provide a wide range of **preprocessing options, metadata editing, spectral identification, and AI operations**.
